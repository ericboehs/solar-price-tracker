## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.4+
- Rails 8.0+
- SQLite3

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-price-tracker.git

```ruby
rails console
User.create!(email_address: "your@email.com", password: "your_password")
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
rails server
```

6. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application
   - Products are publicly accessible
   - Login at `/session/new` to access watches functionality

## üìù Usage

### Basic Operations

- **View Products**: Browse the product grid with price change indicators (public access)
- **Product Details**: Click any product to see detailed price history and charts (public access)
- **Authentication**: Login to access watch management features
- **Create Watches**: Monitor specific URLs for new products or track individual items (requires login)
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes (persists across sessions)

### Web Scraping

Run the scraper manually in Rails console:
```ruby
ProductScraperService.new.scrape_products
```

### Database Management

```bash
# Reset and reseed database
rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed

# Check migration status
rails db:migrate:status
```

## üé® UI Components

- **Product Grid**: Responsive cards with trend indicators and dark mode styling
- **Interactive Charts**: Price visualization with Chart.js and dark mode color detection
- **Watch Management**: CRUD interface for monitoring with advanced filtering
- **Full Screen Modals**: Click product images for full-screen viewing

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application uses Rails credentials for sensitive configuration. No additional environment variables are required for basic operation.

### Database Schema

The application uses SQLite3 by default. Key tables:
- `products`: Product information with slug indexing
- `price_histories`: Historical price data with timestamp indexing  
- `watches`: Polymorphic watch configuration with filtering options
- `users`: Authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- `sessions`: Session management for user authentication

## üß™ Testing

The application has comprehensive test coverage with parallel testing support:

- **167 tests** covering all major components
- **97.97% line coverage** (386/394 lines)
- **89.1% branch coverage** (139/156 branches)
- **SimpleCov integration** with parallel test result merging

Run the test suite:
```bash
bin/rails test
```

For system tests:
```bash
bin/rails test:system
```

View coverage report (generated after running tests):
```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

Code quality and style:
```bash
bin/rubocop -A
```

## üì¶ Deployment

The application is containerized and ready for deployment:

### Using Kamal (Recommended)

1. Set up your server with Docker and configure `config/deploy.yml`
2. Set environment variables in `.envrc`:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
   ```

3. Initial setup:
   ```bash
   kamal setup
   ```

4. Deploy updates:
   ```bash
   kamal deploy
   ```

### Manual Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t solar-price-tracker .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 solar-price-tracker
```

### Production Considerations

- Database seeds are automatically skipped in production
- Ensure proper user accounts are created for production access
- XSS protection is enabled by default
